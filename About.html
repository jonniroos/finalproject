<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>From a young age, I knew I wanted to do something daring and different. I always felt my life was small and mundane, so I wrote adventures to entertain myself.&nbsp; I would create bold new worlds where I was doing exciting things, visiting far away lands and seeking amazing adventures. &nbsp;But what I wanted more than anything was to actually experience my adventures for real. So, in my 20s, I packed up my little life and left for my first adventure: North to Alaska!&nbsp; I spent 20 years traipsing around the The Last Frontier, undertaking of every adventure I could find.&nbsp; I panned for gold along the Bering Sea, dipped my toes in the Arctic Ocean, watched polar bears on ice floes, fed bald eagles on the bay, experienced earthquakes and volcanoes.&nbsp; I even traveled by dog team along the Iditarod Trail.&nbsp; In my 40s I decided Alaska had grown a bit tame, so I started my next adventure: South to New Mexico! The high desert is beautiful and I like to hike and bike in the rocky hills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my life of adventure isn't just about exploring new landscapes, I'm also on a new adventure of seeking personal growth and discovery.&nbsp; Now in my 50s, I'm finally deciding who and what I want to be when I grow up now that I am a grown up. &nbsp;I'm stretching myself to see if I can create a real world for myself out of&nbsp;words as a writer. To that end, I am fulfilling the lifelong goal I promised to myself: I have returned to finish my education, albeit 30 years later.&nbsp; I have completed my Associate of Arts degree in Business Administration and another in Digital Marketing.&nbsp; I am now entering a Bachelor of Arts program in Journalism and Communications.&nbsp; While my degree path seems a bit unusual, my hope is I can combine the knowledge from my Marketing program, my Business program and my Communications program so that I can create a body of knowledge that will be helpful as a content writer for the digital marketplace.</p>
